LRA\_002 Protocol
-----------------

**Goal** Measure (by flow) genes reported to be regulated by JQ1 and Ingenol. References: Darcis et al, doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005063 Banerjee et al: doi: 10.1189/jlb.0312165

**Treatments: To be done in duplicate** 1. PMA/Ionomycin (+ cntl)

1.  DMSO (-cntl)

2.  JQ1 nanoparticles

3.  Ingenol-3 nanoparticles

4.  Both JQ1 and Ingenol-3 nanoparticles

5.  JQ1 free drug

6.  Ingenol-3 free drug

7.  Both JQ1 and Ingenol-3 free drug

**Genes**

CD28: down-regulated by JQ1(Bannerjee et al)

CXCR4: down-regulated by JQ1(Bannerjee et al)

CD40LG: down-regulated by JQ1(Bannerjee et al)

CD69: up-regulated by Ingenol-3 (Darcis et al)

HLA-DR: up-regulated by Igenol-3 (slight)(Darcis et al)

**Number of wells**

For the non-control conditions, we need 2 donors x 6 treatments x 6 concentrations x 2 replicates = 144 wells, 24 per condition.

For the controls, we need 2 donors x 2 treatments x 2 replicate = 8 wells

144 + 8 = 152 wells total

**Donors** 2 x HIV- , total PBMC 150k cells per well x 152 wells = 22.8E6 needed.

**Timing**

Treat with LRAs for 24hr, then stain cells for flow.

**Prepare plate for doing drug dilutions**

In each well, add 100uL R10. Later, 100uL of cells will be added to these wells, diluting the drug that is in there 2-fold, which is why we need to add the drug at a 2X concentration.

**Prepare drug treatments in tubes**

For each serial dilution (3-fold) need to start the dilution with 50uL of the highest concentration (50uL into 150uL = 3-fold dilution).

There will be 2 reps of each dilution x 2 donors so need to make at least 50uL x 4 = 150uL of each starting drug solution for the single drug conditions.

Make 300uL to minimize tears.

For the controls, need 4 reps per control, 100uL each so make 450uL of the starting concentration for each (PMA/Iono, and DMSO).

**Starting Drug Concentrations** Drugs need to be added at 6X the final desired concentration, so that when we add 50uL to the 100uL already in the well, they will be diluted 1:3 to 2X, in preparation for being further diluted 1:2 to 1X when cells are added

**Treatment Doses**

PMA/Ionomycin: 200ng/mL PMA and 2uM Ionomycin

JQ1: We'll start with 9-fold over what SC used for the combination dose

Free drug: Start with 9-fold over 458ng/mL = 4.12ug/mL

LCNP: Start with 9-fold over 680ng/mL = 6.12ug/mL

Ingenol-3: We'll start with 9-fold over what SC used for the combination dose

Free drug: Start with 9-fold over 1.5ng/mL = 13.5ng/mL = 0.0135ug/mL

LCNP: Start with 9-fold over 24ng/mL = 216ng/mL = 0.216ug/mL

**PMA/Ionomycin**

PMA: stock = 100ug/mL, want 400ng/mL, 2x of the final concentration.

Use 1.8uL

Ionomycin: stock = 350ug/mL, want 4uM, 2x of final concentration.

Use 3.6514uL

R10: Bring to 0.45mL with R10 by adding 444.5486uL

**DMSO**

Use the highest concentration of any of the free drugs/3 (to make it 2X) and bring to 0.45mL

### Prepare the JQ1 nanoparticles after everything else is ready because they are fast release and we don't want them to sit around while we're doing other stuff.

**6X Ing free drug single**

SC gave us Ing free drug at 500ug/mL

We only need a little amount, so make a 1:100 dilution of Ing\_FD and then:

Use 4.86 uL, bring to 0.3mL with R10 by adding 295.14uL

Make enough 1:100 to use again for the combo treatment.

**6X Ing NP (chemically conjugated) single**

Resuspend the nanoparticles in R10 to 64ug/mL. Vortex and sonicate until there are no clumps.

Use 6.075 uL, bring to 0.3mL with R10 by adding -307.5uL

**6X JQ1 free drug single**

Use 5.9328uL, bring to 0.3mL with R10 by adding 294.0672uL

**6X JQ1 NP single** Resuspend the nanoparticles in R10 to 71.4ug/mL. Vortex and sonicate until there are no clumps.

Use 154.2857uL bring to 0.3mL with R10 by adding 145.7143uL

**6X combintion of free drugs**

Remember to use the 1:100 diluted Ing\_FD

Use 4.86 uL 1:100 Ing\_FD and 5.9328uL JQ1\_FD, bring to 0.3mL with R10 by adding 289.2072uL

**6X combintion of NP**

Use 6.075 uL Ing\_NP and 154.2857uL JQ1\_NP, bring to 0.3mL with R10 by adding 139.6393uL

### Add drugs and controls to plate

Add 50uL of 6X drug cocktails to starting well and do serial dilutions down to row G.

For controls, add 100uL of 2X.

### Add cells to plate

Donor A is VEU5031 and Donor B is VEU5168

Dilute cells to 1.5E5/100uL = 1.5E6/mL. Add 100uL to each well.

### Incubate plates at 37C for 24hr

### Stain for flow

The flow staining protocol has three steps:

-   Live/dead (in PBS, at RT)
-   CXCR4 (in FACS Wash, at 37C)
-   Everything else (in FACS Wash, at RT)

Live/Dead:

1.  Prepare staining reagent: 15.2 µL Live/Dead Aqua + 7584.8 µL PBS.
2.  Spin cells at 750g for 3 minutes.
3.  Resuspend cells in PBS.
4.  Spin cells at 750g for 3 minutes.
5.  Resuspend cells in 45 µL staining reagent (this accounts for overage because we prepared 50 µL per well).
6.  Incubate in the dark at RT for 20 min.
7.  Add 150 µL FACS Wash to each well.

CXCR4 staining:

1.  Prepare staining reagent: 152 µL CXCR4 BUV396 + 7448 µL FACS Wash.
2.  Spin cells at 750g for 3 minutes.
3.  Resuspend cells in 45 µL staining reagent (this accounts for overage).
4.  Incubate in the dark at **37C** in the incubator for 20 min.
5.  Add 150 µL FACS Wash to each well.

Rest of antibody staining:

1.  Prepare staining cocktail:

-   760 µL CD8 PerCP-Cy5.5
-   760 µL CD3 v450
-   380 µL CD28 PE
-   380 µL CD69 APC
-   380 µL HLA-DR FITC
-   76 µL CD4 ECD
-   102.6 µL CD40L APC-e780
-   4712 µL FACS Wash.

1.  Spin cells at 750g for 3 minutes.
2.  Resuspend cells in 45 µL staining cocktail (this accounts for overage).
3.  Incubate in the dark at RT for 20 min.
4.  Add 150 µL FACS Wash to each well.
5.  Spin cells at 750g for 3 minutes.
6.  Resuspend in 200 µL.
7.  Spin cells at 750g for 3 minutes.
8.  Resuspend in 100 µL 1% PFA in FACS Wash (prepare 16.72 mL by adding 1.672 mL 10% PFA to 15.048 mL FACS Wash)
9.  Place at 4C.
